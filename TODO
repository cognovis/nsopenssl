Todo List:

* Figure out if this is really a problem with nsopenssl; if so, fix it:

Scott,

I just discovered last night that there are still experiencing some problems
with large files in nsopenssl-2.1a4. One of our page developers decided
they really needed a 32994 byte javascript for a menu system (shakes head).
Anyway, when I transfer the file, it gets a little scrambled. At byte 32000,
extra random data is inserted. Last night I was get back a file that was
almost 42Kbytes. This morning I'm only getting an extra 100 or so bytes.

I'm running with AOLserver 3.3+arsdigita patches on Solaris 8.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

* Should probably fix form.tcl to do the right thing.

form.tcl doesn't respect the fact that a boundary
value declaration may be wrapped in double quotes. It will work
with this:

   multipart/form-data, boundary=--123456789

but not this:

   multipart/form-data, boundary="--123456789"

       
---------------------------------------------------------------------

* Change EOF / peer aborts connection error message to be a notice or
  debug statement.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

* Add IP to EOF's and other errors logged.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

* Update the documentation to reflect latest changes for 2.1.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

* Take out nsdserver's message about client cert being valid.
