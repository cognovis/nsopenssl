TODO and IDEAS:


- Get working with AOLserver 4.x

- Create fully automated tests for nsopenssl that can run without a browser. Issues
  will include how to configure AOLserver's nsd.tcl file for the testing. OpenSSL
  and other programs may be required for testing as well. Not sure how to handle this,
  other than distributing my test and debugging development platform.

- Test Eric's old nsssl key and cert with nsopenssl

- Apply patch to fix OpenSSL version info in nsopenssl.

- Add a version.h file, like the one found in nsoracle. See if I can get 
  tag-release and file-release to automatically update the release number in the file.


NOTES ON C CODE:

- Ns_Sock * is passed to OpenSSLProc for AOLserver 4.x. This is important,
  because the first element in Ns_Sock is a pointer to the Ns_Driver struct,
  which contains all the info needed to run the conn. (How do I use this
  info within nsopenssl? I could add a pointer to the driver at first i/o
  within OpenSSLProc, then have that available for the conn always...)
