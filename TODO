TODO and IDEAS:

- Add a version.h file, like the one found in nsoracle. See if I can get 
  tag-release and file-release to automatically update the release number in the file.

- Create fully automated tests for nsopenssl that can run without a browser. Issues
  will include how to configure AOLserver's nsd.tcl file for the testing. OpenSSL
  and other programs may be required for testing as well. Not sure how to handle this,
  other than distributing my test and debugging development platform.
