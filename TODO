Things that need to be done:

- Find a way to automatically retrieve the OpenSSL version so
  we can put that in the info command.

- Add back option to specify client verification depth

- Add ability for server to return nice error page to client when
  they've connected to the HTTPS port with HTTP (it happens). Maybe
  even a nice link they can click on, and/or a redirect to the same
  page via HTTPS.

- Add an ErrorPage option to the config file to give user friendly
  error message when they have an invalid or no certificate.

- Add more Tcl commands for examining the server's cert, generating
  keypairs and CSRs etc.

- Add Certificate Revocation support. Should optionally pass through
  nsopenssl and be handled by the app. Not sure how to do this
  consistently though, and it may need to be handled as a
  site-specific Tcl implentation. At DoD, our CRL is really just a
  list of the revoked certificate's serial numbers.

- Have 'make' automatically run at server start time in the ssl.ca
  directory.

- Add multiple-server support. If you have three virtual servers in
  OpenNSD/AOLserver 4.x, you must use the same SSL cert for each. Why?
  Because the nsopenssl module has no way of knowing which server
  you're trying to connect to apriori so it cannot select a different
  server cert. Only way to get around this is to have each virtual
  server have it's own IP address, set nsopenssl to map an IP to
  a server certificate and off you go. You can (usually) set multiple 
  IPs to one network card, or have multiple network cards on your
  system.
