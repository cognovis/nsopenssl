Things that need to be done:
Scott S. Goodwin - scott@scottg.net

- MSIE 5.x doesn't work with this module yet. It breaks the connection
  to the server and then prompts you to select the client cert that
  you want to use, then reconnects. You're supposed to get a
  passphrase box from MSIE next, and something does popup, but there
  is nowhere to type in the passphrase. I'm not sure whether the
  problem is with the nsopenssl or MSIE, but I suspect nsopenssl isn't
  handling the disconnect properly, because it used to work fine, and
  I'm not sure what I changed that caused this problem. OpenSSL's
  s_client works fine, as does Netscape. All three were using the same
  client certificate.

- Add more Tcl commands for examining the server's cert, generating
  keypairs and CSRs etc.

- Caching was flakey before. I have it half-working. Before, the cache
  delete callback was being called when the connection was closed,
  thus removing the cached session. Not sure what the behavior should
  be here yet. Now, the first connection gets cached, and it's used
  for the second connection. The third connection finds the cached
  session, but a new session id is generated anyway and we have to go
  through the whole process again.

- There are lots of comments sprinkled throughout the code that begin
  with "TODO:". Some are bugs, some are features that could be added,
  and that I'll get to.

- Add Certificate Revocation support. Should optionally pass through
  nsopenssl and be handled by the app.

- Lots of cleanup. I'm new to C and I'm afraid I've left a lot of
  cruft lying around.

- The nsd.tcl config parameters need to be scrutinized:
  ns_param ClientVerify              true
  ns_param ClientVerifyDepth         3
  ns_param ClientVerifyOnce          true
  ns_param ClientVerifyDefault       true
  ns_param ClientCACertPath          ssl.ca
  ns_param ClientCACertFile          ssl.ca/ca-bundle.crt

- Testing -- lots of it. Maybe even a regression suite to run against
  each release.

- Compilation against OpenSSL 0.9.6.
