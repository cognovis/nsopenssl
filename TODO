nsopenssl TODO:

Goals:

- Make nsopenssl handle multiple virtual servers with multiple ports per
  virtual server while only loading nsopenssl.so once for AOLserver 4.x.

- Give nsopenssl the ability to perform certificate operations so it can be
  used to drive a CA process.

TODO:

- use NsOpenSSLServers hash to manage drivers on a per-server basis in OpenSSLDriverInit
- validate driver init, operation, shutdown and free'ing
- validate SSL context load, init, locking, use of, shutdown and free'ing operations
- fix SSL handshake tracing
- test accessing named SSL contexts for a particular virtual server
- make sure struct locking is done where needed
- set up session cache contexts and/or use 'nsopenssl-' prefix in session cache ids
- extract global C API calls into libnsopenssl.so.
- review Ns_Log statements for accuracy
- ignore any ciphers or protocols listed in config that weren't compiled into OpenSSL library
- fix OpenSSL version reporting
- convert to TclObj commands
- add IP address for logged events
- allow for Tcl API sock servers/clients to have C or Tcl callback set via nsd.tcl
- update Tcl API to allow for dynamically creating / using new SSL contexts
- create pool of reusable conn structures
- create Ns_OpenSSLWrap C API functions
- update C and Tcl API to allow for generation of CA / Client / Server cert
- add CRL support
- add Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) support.
- create 'dup' function that can dup a named SSL context struct
- clean up codebase to be completely consistent with AOLserver coding conventions
- validate PRNG functioning
