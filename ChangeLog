	* nsopenssl.c: Integrated changes made by Freddie Mendoza
	(avm@satori.com). These included: changed NsSSLRecv and
	NsSSLCreateConn to use OpenSSL BIO routines, added more debugging
	in the SSL negotiations, changes made to make caching work better,
	removed some redundant functions that are now part of the
	AOLserver core. He tested his changes with OpenSSL 0.9.5a and
	0.9.4. I'm using it with 0.9.5a without any problems.

	* Makefile: Added ability to pass BSAFE directory as a parameter
	to make. This allows you to compile OpenSSL with BSAFE. See the
	readme.txt file.

	* readme.txt: Added notes on how to compile with BSAFE.

	notes about -fPIC and no-asm options when building the OpenSSL
	library.
	
	* Added to $TOP/nsopenssl with new Makefile.
